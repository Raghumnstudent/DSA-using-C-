1) what is time complexity T(n) for the following code?

a=1
b=1
while(b<=n):
{
a+=1
b+=1
coun<<"hi";
}

Time complexity of the code is O(n) ot T(n) = O(n)

2) write the output of the following code n=3

void fun(int n)
{
if(n>0)
{
cout<<n;
fun(n-1)
cout<<n; 
}
}

output is 3 2 1 1 2 3
